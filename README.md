## Conda (Setup and Environment)

To make the project reproducible and ensure smooth package management, this project uses Conda as a package and environment manager. Below are the steps to set up the environment:


1. **Install Conda**:
If you haven't installed Conda yet, you can download it from the official [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) websites. Anaconda is a larger distribution with more pre-installed packages, while Miniconda is a smaller, minimal version. Choose whichever suits your needs.

2. **Create a new environment:** Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Conda environment with Python 3.12:

    ```bash
    conda create --name new_conda_env python=3.12
    ```

3. **Activate the environment:** Once the environment is created, activate it by running:

    ```bash
    conda activate new_conda_env
    ```

4. **Install required packages (Jupyter, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Pandas and Scikit-Learn)**

    ```bash
    conda install jupyter numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
    ```

5. **Run Jupyter Notebook**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
